# AndroidStudio-Activities-Fragments
-Create 2 Activity classes. The first one will contain a static fragment and the second one a container to add fragments.
-We'll note F1A1 fragment no.1 from activity no.1.
-F1A1 will contain a button which will send the user to the second activity.
-F1A2 will contain a button which will add F2A2.
-F2A2 will contain 3 buttons (verticaly centered):
     -Button1 - Replace F2A2 with F3A2.
     -Button2 - Go back to F1A2.
     -Button2 - Close the activity.
-Pressing back from the second activity will close the app.
